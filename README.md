# Ripped-Games
This is a github repo that has way too many html ports for school gaming.
# How to use
- go to the game you want to download, and click on it.
- you should see a download button, click it.
- go to your files, and drag the file into the web browser tabs.
- YOU CAN NOT DELETE THE FILE. the game only works if the file is in your computer.
- as far as we know, this is an unstoppable tactic. unless they block github, witch we have workarounds.
- courtasey to BOG and the truffled team for ripping the games.
- each game is tested on lightspeed and is updated accordingly
